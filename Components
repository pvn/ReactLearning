### Custom Component:

We will learn, how to create our own custom components which can be used multiple places whereever is required.
So lets add a new folder called 'component' inside a project which will have our own custom components.

Before learning the custom component, lets first understand about the most used component in ReactNative called FlatList.

> FlatList has two important properties-
    > first property is the data property where you point at your input data and this should point at an array
    > second property is render item, that takes a function which is called for every item
